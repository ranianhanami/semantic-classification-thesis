# semantic-classification-thesis

We created a collection of Indonesian health questions people ask online (964 questions in total). Each question is categorized based on its meaning (e.g., questions about symptoms, treatments). These categories are based on a system developed by Roberts et al. (2014) and verified by a medical professional.
This work is part of my thesis.
